Welcome to the Music Store Analysis Project! In this project we will analyse the sales and customer data of a music store 
using PostgreSQL. The analysis aims to provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance to 
inform strategic decisions for the store.

## Introduction

We're leveraging PostgreSQL to analyze sales and customer data, aiming to provide actionable insights for music store optimization.
By dissecting transactional data and customer demographics, we uncover trends, forecast sales, and evaluate product performance. 
Armed with these insights, music store owners can refine strategies, enhance customer experiences, and drive profitability.

## Analysis Questions Resolved

During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data analysis techniques:

1. Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
2. Which countries have the most Invoices?
3. What are top 3 values of total invoice?
4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music
Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that
has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice
totals.
5. Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be
declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the
most money.
6. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music
listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.
7. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a
query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.
8. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length.
Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the
longest songs listed first.
9. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return
customer name, artist name and total spent.
10. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the
most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query
that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum
number of purchases is shared return all Genres.
11. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each
country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how
much they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all
customers who spent this amount.

## Schema- Music Store Database

Schema has been created to visualize the relationships between
the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a SQL environment set up to execute queries.
3. Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4. Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyze the data and derive insights.
5. Customize the analysis or queries as needed for your specific objectives.
   
## Conclusion

In conclusion, the music store project highlights the importance of staying adaptable to market trends, 
diversifying product offerings, enhancing customer experiences, monitoring the competitive landscape, .
and engaging with the community. By implementing these strategies, the store can position itself for long-term 
success in the dynamic music industry.
